"Advection_AmrCore"

This tutorial contains an AMR advection code that advects a single 
scalar field with a velocity field that is specified on faces.

The directory Exec/SingleVortex includes a GNUmakefile and a sample inputs file.  

****************************************************************************************************

To run it in serial,

./main2d.gnu.MPI.ex inputs

To run it in parallel, for example on 4 ranks:

mpirun -n 4 ./main2d.gnu.MPI.ex inputs

The following parameters can be set at run-time -- these are currently set in the inputs
file but you can also set them on the command line.


n_cell = 128                             # number of cells in x-direction; we double this in the y-direction
max_grid_size = 64                       # the maximum number of cells in any direction in a single grid

plot_int = 10                            # frequency of writing plotfiles

initial_tracer_file = tracers_file_2d    # name of file where we specify the input positions of the particles

time_step = 0.001                        # we advance the particles with a fixed time step of this size

max_time = 10.0                          # the final time (if max_time < max_steps * time_step)

max_steps = 10000                        # the maximum number of steps (if max_steps * time_step < max_time))

obstacles = 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8            # this is how we choose which obstacles to include
